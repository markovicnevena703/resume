Besides parliament, I participated in Sociology Club which included giving presentations on related topics, 
            conducting small studies among peers and gaining knowledge about human behavior. </td>

            and nursing homes are all experiences which challenged my ability to adapt, cooperate and problem-solve.  </td>

        Delegating tasks, making sure all equipment and documentation is in place are just some of my responsibilities. In addition, within the society I got a chance to
        organize science related events locally such as Earth Hour and workshops in primary schools so as to popularize science among our youth. Planning, orchestrating dialog and outside-the-box thinking are some skills I developed along the way.
